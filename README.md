This is a 30-Minute Kettlebell Workout Generator web application! Our platform offers users the flexibility to tailor their workouts according to their fitness levels and preferences. With options ranging from various difficulty levels to workout types including push, pull, legs, and full body routines, users can easily customize their exercise sessions to suit their needs.

## Problem Description
This was mainly a personal problem, to keep costs down i stayed away from a gym membership and purchased a kettlebell instead, but i started getting tired of doing the same youtube workout videos. As i looked around for any workout plans, i found that there was a lot of youtube workouts and blog workouts doing the same thing.

## Solution Approach
So with my final project for Harvard's CS50 coming up and this idea, i decided to created this kettlebell workout generator. This gives a 30-minute kettlebell workout thats generated at random from a database of exercises. Making each workout different every time and less scrolling through youtube videos.
